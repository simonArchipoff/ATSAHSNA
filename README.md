# ATSAHSNA

This project aims to be a free/libre software to perform accoustical measures, some kind of REW.
It's licenced under GPLv3. For now it's under heavy development, you can play with it but please dont build something with it.

What's already implemented:
- two backend (faust and jackd), for jackd you'll need a 96kHz sound interface to have good results above 10kHz, 48kHz isn't enough.
- impulse response, harmonic spectrum, THD computation
- wavelet waterfall measures
- temporal response
- a very poor GUI, sorry

Soon :
- reactive interface (temporary bug)
- something to deal with latency more easily
- export measurements in a bunch of standards files
- better UI
- less franglish and proper translations
- dealing with several input/output (to measure two channels at once for instance)
- having several measure displayed at once
- simpler code (I am t√¢tonning)

Later :
- Implementing what's needed to measures an impedance and/or do computation with inputs
- a full laplace transform backend, with physical measures (?)
- Some kind of knob-turning algorithm to create model of a measured function (eg, turning a faust equalizer's knobs to flatten a response).

Sooner or later :
- I hope I'll be able to propose a headless system able to compute data such as THD against power or THD against freqency


to install and try :
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
cmake -S . -B build && make -j 8 -C build
./build/ATSAHSNA 
```

Dependancy:
* Qt
* FFTW
* fCWT (a wavelet lib, in a git submodule, this lib itself also depends on FFTW)
* Faust
* Jack
* moodycamel lockfree queue (already in the repository)
