# ATSAHSNA

This project aims to be a free/libre software to perform accoustical measures, some kind of REW without the "ew",
It's licenced under GPLv3. For now it's under heavy development, you can play with it but please dont build something with it.

What's already implemented:
- two backend (faust and jackd)
- impulse response, harmonic spectrum and THD+N computation (in temporal domain as well)
- a very poor UI, sorry

Soon :
- something to deal with the latency more easily
- wavelet waterfall measures
- export measurements in a bunch of standards files
- better UI
- less franglish and proper translations
- dealing with several input/output (to measure two channels at once for instance)
- simpler code (I am t√¢tonning)

Later :
- Implementing what's needed to measures an impedance and/or do computation with inputs
- a full laplace transform backend, with physical measures (?)
- Some kind of knob-turning algorithm to create model of a measured function (eg, turning a faust equalizer's knobs to flatten a response).

I'll try not to spread qt things all around so that it'll be easy to make a script friendly measure tool.
I hope I'll be able to propose a headless system able to compute data such as THD against power or THD against freqency

Dependancy:
* Qt
* QCoro
* FFTW
* fCWT (wavelet lib, in a git submodule)
* Faust
* Jack
* doctest 
* moodycamel lockfree queue (already in the repository)
